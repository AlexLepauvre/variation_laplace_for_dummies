# Variational Laplace for dummies

Welcome to the Variational Laplace for dummies repository! This project aims to demystify the concepts of Variational Bayes and Laplace Approximation for individuals without a heavy mathematical background. If you're curious about Bayesian statistics but have felt overwhelmed by complex papers and mathematical jargon, this book is for you.

## üìñ About the Book

As a biologist with (soon) a PhD in consciousness neuroscience, I had minimal exposure to advanced mathematics during my academic journey. My background includes:
- Using frequentist statistical tools, from simple t-tests to complex linear models.
- Applying machine learning and multivariate methods in research.

Along the way, I became intrigued by Bayesian statistics due to its flexibility and its alignment with the types of questions I was asking, such as:
- "How much evidence do I have for a particular hypothesis or theory?"

Bayesian methods provide a formal quantification of evidence, which is invaluable in scientific inquiry.

## The Motivation
I specifically got interested in the Variational Laplace method because it offers a way to compute the model evidence part of Bayes' theorem for various models used in neuroscience: the generalized linear model (GLM), which covers both Univariate and multivariate data, mixed and hierarchical designs, as well as dynamical causal model (DCM).

However, I found existing papers on the subject daunting. Not because they were poorly written, but because they assumed a level of mathematical understanding that I‚Äîand many others‚Äîdid not possess. The connections between concepts were often considered "obvious" and left unexplained, making it challenging to follow along.

## The Revelation

Determined to understand whether the math was truly that complicated, I spent time breaking down the concepts. To my surprise, I found that:
- The mathematics can be understood with basic algebra and arithmetic learned in high school.
- The complexity often arises from unexplained jumps between steps, not from inherently difficult math.

## The Solution

This realization led me to create this book:
- Variational Laplace by a Dummy, for Dummies

I aim to bridge the gap between complex mathematical presentations and accessible understanding.

# üõ† How This Book Helps You

To ensure clarity and accessibility, I've employed several strategies:

- Wordy Explanations: Concepts are explained in detailed, plain language. I repeat important ideas in different ways to reinforce understanding.

- Mathematical Formulas: Key formulas are provided alongside explanations to connect the verbal descriptions with mathematical expressions.

- Python Code Translation: Every significant formula is translated into Python code. This serves multiple purposes:
    Visualization: Code allows for visual representations of concepts.
    Practical Understanding: Seeing how formulas translate into code can deepen comprehension.
    Accessibility: It caters to those who might be intimidated by complex formulas but are comfortable with programming.

- Jupyter Notebooks: The entire book is built using Jupyter notebooks, allowing for interactive exploration:
    Modify code examples.
    Visualize outputs immediately.
    Engage with the material hands-on.

# Who Can Benefit?

- Readers with Basic Math Knowledge: No advanced math background is required.
- Math Enthusiasts New to Programming: If you're comfortable with math but not programming, the code examples are explained thoroughly.
- Programmers Intimidated by Complex Formulas: If you understand code better than equations, this book bridges that gap.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
Work in Progress: This book is currently a work in progress. Content is still being developed and refined.
Under Review: While I've partnered with a co-author proficient in mathematics who has reviewed the material, it hasn't been fully verified and proofread by mathematicians yet.
Use with Caution: Given the above, please take the content with a grain of salt at this time. Feedback and corrections are welcome!

# üåü Goals of the Repository
- Demystify Complex Concepts: Break down Variational Bayes and Laplace Approximation into understandable segments.
- Provide a Learning Resource: Serve as a stepping stone for those interested in Bayesian methods but deterred by heavy math.
- Encourage Exploration: Empower readers to delve into statistical methods applicable across neuroscience and other fields.
