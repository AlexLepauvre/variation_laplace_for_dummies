    "\n",
    "We have finally made it to the main topic of the book: **variational Laplace**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in the previous section that if we want to answer a question of the kind \"Is there a relationship between penguins flipper length and their weights\", we can use a linear model. In order to answer our question in Bayesian term, we want to obtain the **posterior probability distribution**, that tells us the likelihood of the true value of the parameter of our model given the data we have measured in our experiment. If it is highly unlikely that the parameter that relates penguin flipper lengths to their weight in the model ($\\beta_1$) is equal to 0 (or close thereof), then we can answer our question and say 'yes, there is a relationship between penguin flipper lengths and their weights\", or even better, we can say \"I am 95% confident that the relationship between the 2 is between this value and that value\". Following the Bayes Theorem, to compute the **posterior**, we need to multiply the **likelihood** of the data under all values of our parameters by our **prior** belief of the likelihood of each parameter and divide the whole by the **marginal likelihood**, also called **model evidence**, which is the likelihood of the data after marginalizing all possible values of the parameters of our model. Because we are dealing with a linear model, the likelihood of our data is a multivariate normal distribution, due to the assumption that the error of our model is normally distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is however one main problem: we can't solve the **marginal likelihood** analytically. This is because there is an integral in the formula of the marginal likelihood. To compute it, e would need to compute one by one the results of a function for an infinity of values, and then sum all these values together, which is of course impossible to do. "

Each column contains all the value of one regressor, each row the value of all regressor associated with each data point. In our example, $x_0$ is the intercept, so it's the same in each row: $x_{0_1} = x_{0_2} = 1$, while $x_1$ is the weight of our penguins, so $x_{1, 1}$ is the weight of the first penguin whose weight is $y_1$ and so on for all our penguins\n",

We don't know the true values, but can estimate the **observed values** of these parameters that generate a line that fits the data the best, i.e. that minimize the residuals sum of square (RSS) by using OLS (see below). The values found by the OLS are the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE), which means that the likelihood of the data is maximized under these parameter (see likelihood function below)\n",

It is an assumption, meaning that if this is not true, we shouldn't use this kind of model.  We assume that the mean of the distribution is 0, which means that negative errors (underestimations) are equally likely as positive errors (overestimations). The $\\sigma^2$ on the other hands is not assumed and depends on the data. The variance parameter of the distribution controls its spread, meaning that large $\\sigma^2$ implies that large error are more likely compared to when $\\sigma^2$ is small. and we can also find the MLE for this parameters, i.e. the value of $\\sigma^2$ under which the data are the most likely\n",

Accordingly, we can try to find the $\\beta$ and $\\sigma^2$ under which the data are most likely, which is what we do when we **fit the model** to the data.

    "## Variational Laplace: a method to approximate the marginal likelihood\n",
    "If we can't compute the marginal likelihood, we can't compute the posterior and we can't answer our original question. This is where the **variational Laplace** method comes into play. This method calls on rather advanced mathematics (by my standards at least), but the gist idea is the following: instead of trying to solve the marginal likelihood, we try to approximate it by calculating something that should approach it. There are many bits and pieces of mathematics associated with the method (both the implementation and the justification of why it works). None of them are incredibly complicated on their own, but it is a bit difficult to understand how they all fit together. We will explore each bit in a progressive order, so that by the end of it, you hopefully have a good understanding of it! Let's dive in."
