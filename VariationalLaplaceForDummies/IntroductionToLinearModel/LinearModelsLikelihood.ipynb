    "# The likelihood of the estimated parameters of a linear model:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first need we need is a function for the likelihood of the data under given parameters. That's the same concept as before, but it is a little bit more complicated, for several reasons. The first reason is that compared to our coin toss example where the probability of observing a given number of heads depended on a single parameter of interest (the probability of getting head), in our current problem we have several parameters: $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$ (but also the error term). Accordingly, we need a likelihood function that tells us the probability of observing a given outcome $y_i$ given the value of several parameters. In addition, compared to the previous example where the data were a single observation $y$ (the number of head we observed in our experiment), in the current case we have many observations $y_i$ (one per penguin). We will see how to deal with these two complications one by one before putting everything together. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The likelihood of one observation\n",
    "The first need we need is a function for the likelihood of the data under given parameters. It's easy to get confused at this point, so let's clarify. In Bayesian inference, the likelihood is the probability of observing the data given particular values of the parameters. It answers questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"If $\\beta_0=0$ and $\\beta_1=0.21$, what is the probability of observing a penguin with flipper length 190mm that weight 70 kg?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the likleihood is a probability density function, which is a function that can answer that question for any values of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you continue reading, try to think about what that could look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "An intuition you might have is that values of $yi$​ close to the prediction of your model should be more likely. Indeed, if you examine the error distribution histogram from earlier, you'll notice there are fewer penguins with large errors and more with smaller errors. Formally, this suggests that the likelihood of observing the data given certain parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$​ is higher when the observed data are close to the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you tried to look at the likelihood of the data separately for each parameter, you might expect to see something resembling a normal distribution: the data close to the expected value should be most likely, and the likelihood should decrease as you move further away. However, you cannot look at the likelihood of the data for each parameter separately; you need to consider them together. This is because the probability of observing a given data point $y_i$​ depends on both $\\beta_0$​ and $\\beta_1$​ simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "To proceed, it would be helpful to know the form of the distribution that represents the likelihood of observing a given data point given these parameters. We can achieve this by making an assumption about the error term $\\epsilon$​ to ensure that the likelihood function is normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, our model is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So our data y_i is basically a constant ($beta_0$), plus a constant ($beta_1$) multiplied by so fixed values (flipper length, $x_i$), plus the error term. As we already mentioned, one assumption of the linear model is that the $\\epsilon$ is normally distributed around 0, so it is a normal distribution. This is stated as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which means that the error follows a normal distribution centered on 0 and with standard deviation $\\sigma$. Actually, the very reason behind the assumption that the error should be normally distributed is so that the likelihood function also follows a normal distribution. If that's not the case, everything breaks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**So what's the formula for the likelihood of a single observation $y_i$ given the parameters? $P(y_i|\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma^2)$**\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't be able to go into the why here (perhaps we will write a separate chapter about it at some point), but the answer is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(y_i|\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} \\exp{-\\frac{(y_i-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*x_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you remember the normal distribution formulae from above, it's basically the same, except we replaced the $\\mu$ term by: $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*x_i$. This kind of makes sense when you think about it: the mean value in the case of a linear regression is the value predicted by the model. This is called the **expected value**. If you have your observation $y_i$ very far away from your model, then $(y_i-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*x_i))^2$ increases, and because you have a minus in front, the exponent yields a smaller result. And so the further away your observation is from your model predicted value ($\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*x_i$), the more the likelihood decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write some code to illustrate this function. We will first simulate some data then use the optimal least square method to retrive the fitted values of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$. Then, we will compute the error of each single point to find the data point which has the smallest error, and the one that has the largest error. Again, the likelihood function give us the likelihood of the observation given any values of the parameters. And we saw that the probability of observing the data should be concentrated around the values of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ that result in prediction that are closest to that observation"

The results look like there is a ridge along which the probability of the data is very high, and everyhing outside of it is very low. This shape is however to be expected. This is because with a single data point, there isn't enough data to determine the likelihood of the data given the parameter. In the current example, we are looking at the likelihood of observing a penguin weighting 43.85Kg with flipper size of 196mm, given the values of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ and our model $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * x$.

    "Now that we know the likelihood for a single observation, we can try and understand how we can deal with many observation. Indeed, for our current model, we want to know not only the likelihood of observing a value $y_i$ but rather the likelihood of observing all the data $y$ (all the penguins with their flipper length and weights) given the parameters. For this, we need to call upon an additional assumption of a linear model: the data should be independently and identically distributed, which relates ot our previous assumption about the normal distribution of the error. What that means is that we need to assume that each observation is independent from each other. If that is the case (which it should always be if you are running a linear model), then the likelihood of observing all data point is the product of the likelihood of each data point:\n",
    "\n",

Similarly, if β1β1​ deviates from its true value (as shown by the blue lines), adjusting $\\beta_0$ can compensate for this discrepancy, resulting in a line that aligns well with the observed data. This illustrates why there is a correlation between $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ in the likelihood function: there are multiple pairs of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ that yield similar fits to the data.

Because there are multiple pairs of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ (not just the ground truth values) that can produce predictions close to the observed data—and because adjustments in one parameter can be compensated by changes in the other—we observe this elongated shape in the likelihood surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you see an elongated shape like this in a likelihood plot, it indicates that the two variables on the axes—in our case, $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$-are correlated. It's important to clearly understand what we mean by this correlation, so I will repeat it one last time: it means that the likelihood of the data remains high for certain combinations of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$, and that changing one parameter can be offset by adjusting the other to maintain a similar level of fit to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you might think that in our current example, it is what it is: $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are correlated in terms of likelihood. It is after all true that in what we saw above, there are specific pairs of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ that yield a line that is a good approximation of the data, and simply because of how our model is constructed, these values of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are correlated: if we increase $\\beta_0$, we can salvage it by reducing $\\beta_1$ and the other way around. Why would we want to do anything about it, if it is just the way it is? Well actually, we do want to do something about it, because as we will see below, it is a bit of a problem. In short, there are several related issues posed by this correlation: \n",
    "- the estimates may become unreliable, because it makes it more likely when you are dealing with real data that the parameters you retrieve with the OLS method are off, because you get a wrong $\\beta_0$ and its compensatory $\\beta_1$ or the other way around\n",
    "- it increases the domain of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ under which the data are likely, which impacts the computation of the $\\sigma$ parameter as we will see in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as it turns out, there is actually a simple way in which we can deal with this issue: centering $x$, meaning you subtract the mean flipper length from each penguin flipper length. This results in the mean of the centered $x$ to be 0 instead of the actual mean value. That way, changed in $\\beta_0$ represents the mean of the data and $beta_1$ the slope of the correlation between flipper length and weight, and $beta_0$ and $beta_1$ become independent. This is why it is always a good idea to center your predictors. We can see what that looks like:"

Well in fact, they would be exactly the same if we were to sample the $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ more (i.e. if instead of taking a 1000 samples in the interval we took 10000 or more). This makes sense: the OLS finds the values of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ that minimize the error, and the likelihood of observing the data is maximum for the parameters of  $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ that minimize the error. So you can think about it that way: the OLS finds the values of  $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ under which the data are the most likely, or that the OLS finds the peak of the likelihood. It's important to understand the distinction: the OLS returns single points, while the likelihood is a distribution. \n",

    "and provided that the values of x are centered (i.e. there is no correlation between $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ anymore), the likelihood looks like a bell. There is one important thing we need to add for completeness' sake. In our example, we have only one regressor. But in a linear model, we can have many (in which case we have a multiple regression).
